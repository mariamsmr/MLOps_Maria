M9 DOCKER
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Docker provides this kind of system-level reproducibility by creating isolated programs dependencies.
Docker has three main concepts: docker file, docker image and docker container:
- Docker file: is a basic text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to run an application. 
- Docker image: executable package of software that includes everything (application code, libraries, tools, dependencies etc.) necessary to make an application run
- Docker container: the same image can be launched multiple times, creating multiple containers.
